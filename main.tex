\section{Introduction}

I'm Sahal and I'm trying to learn \LaTeX! Most of the content in this document is gonna be about me, my projects or just placeholder jibberish. Now let me tell you something I found really interesting. $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ This is Pythagoras' theorem, and it suggests that given a triangle, and it's sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse, the value of $a^2 + b^2$ is going to be the same as $c^2$. Furthermore, to extract the true value of $c$, one may use the expression $\sqrt{c}$. Truly fascinating.

Now let us get the tenth of $c$, which can be written as

$$\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{10}$$

AMAZINGLY FASCINATING.....
